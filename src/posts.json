      "text": "Just to be clear scientifically,  it is the vaccinated NOT the unvaccinated spreading the mutant variants. This is from inoculating during the pandemic with a poor neutralizing “vaccine”. This is what has happened with numerous other “leaky” (non-neutralizing) vaccines. The classic example of this is Marek’s disease in chickens. I warned the CDC of this in April of this year. Others warned them as well as other scientific entities world wide, months earlier. Yet here we are. So please spare me the propaganda that the unvaccinated are the ones “ causing” this because they are not and there is a clearly defined mechanistic pathway for how the vaccinated are creating the mutants. The solution would be to STOP vaccinating with these terrible GTs and start treating everyone at high risk and those not at high risk who are symptomatic with cheap safe and effective hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin until the virus is driven out. This would stop the binding, replication and transmission of the virus as well as ameliorate some pathogenic processes due to spike in the vaxxed. Oh and it would cost virtually nothing... and therein lies the problem!",
